# Simulation-of-Cylindrical-Heating-element-in-convective-Environment

Conjugate Heat Transfer simulation of a heating element in convective environment. Air is passing @ 0.001m/s from left to right. the solid is being heated from the inside upto 500 deg Kelvin for 500s and the heat source is switched off.
The temperature contour plot can be viewed in the video.
